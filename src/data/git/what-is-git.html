<p>
  Git is a <strong>distributed version control system</strong> used to track changes
  in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work
  on the same project efficiently, safely, and independently.
</p>

<p>
  Git was originally created in <strong>2005</strong> by Linus Torvalds, the creator of
  Linux. It was developed to replace <strong>BitKeeper</strong>, a proprietary version
  control system previously used for the Linux kernel, after licensing issues arose.
  The design of Git was heavily influenced by the needs of large-scale,
  fast-moving, open-source projects.
</p>

<p>
  From the beginning, Git was built with several key goals in mind:
</p>

<ul class="list-none ml-0 space-y-4">
  <li class="relative pl-6 before:content-['>'] before:text-[#006EC7] before:absolute before:left-0"><strong>Support for non-linear development</strong> through lightweight branching and merging</li>
  <li class="relative pl-6 before:content-['>'] before:text-[#006EC7] before:absolute before:left-0"><strong>Distributed development</strong>, allowing developers to work independently and collaborate later</li>
  <li class="relative pl-6 before:content-['>'] before:text-[#006EC7] before:absolute before:left-0"><strong>Compatibility with existing systems and protocols</strong> such as SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS</li>
  <li class="relative pl-6 before:content-['>'] before:text-[#006EC7] before:absolute before:left-0"><strong>Efficient handling of large projects</strong> with thousands of files and long histories</li>
  <li class="relative pl-6 before:content-['>'] before:text-[#006EC7] before:absolute before:left-0"><strong>Cryptographic authentication of history</strong>, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of commits</li>
  <li class="relative pl-6 before:content-['>'] before:text-[#006EC7] before:absolute before:left-0"><strong>Pluggable merge strategies</strong>, enabling different approaches to combining changes</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Git follows a <strong>repository-based model</strong>. A Git repository contains
  the complete project history, including all branches and commits. Because each
  clone is a full repository, there is no single point of failure, and collaboration
  remains flexible and resilient.
</p>

<p>
  Modern Git workflows often follow <strong>agile development practices</strong>.
  Short-lived branches, frequent commits, and regular merges help teams iterate
  quickly and respond to change. In many projects, the <strong>main</strong> branch
  represents stable, deployable code, while new features and fixes are developed in
  separate branches and merged back once they are ready.
</p>

<p>
  Git itself is a <strong>command-line tool</strong> and works entirely locally. To
  collaborate with others, Git is commonly used together with remote hosting
  platforms such as:
</p>

<ul class="list-none ml-0 space-y-4">
  <li class="flex items-center gap-2">
    <iconify-icon icon="mdi:github" width="20"></iconify-icon>
    <strong>GitHub</strong> – A popular platform for open-source projects and team collaboration
  </li>

  <li class="flex items-center gap-2">
    <iconify-icon icon="logos:gitlab-icon" width="20"></iconify-icon>
    <strong>GitLab</strong> – Provides built-in CI/CD pipelines and supports self-hosted installations
  </li>

  <li class="flex items-center gap-2">
    <iconify-icon icon="logos:bitbucket" width="20"></iconify-icon>
    <strong>Bitbucket</strong> – Often used alongside Atlassian tools such as Jira and Confluence
  </li>

  <li class="flex items-center gap-2">
    <iconify-icon icon="devicon:azuredevops" width="20"></iconify-icon>
    <strong>Azure DevOps</strong> – An enterprise platform offering Git hosting, CI/CD, and project management
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These platforms extend Git with features like issue tracking, code reviews,
  continuous integration, and access control, making collaboration easier and more
  structured—especially for teams and large organizations.
